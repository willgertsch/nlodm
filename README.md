# nlodm: Optimal Designs for Nonlinear Models using Metaheuristics

This package supports finding optimal designs for nonlinear models using nature-inspired algorithms. General nonlinear models are supported, but there is focus on models commonly used in toxicology. Future work will include Bayesian and multi-objective designs, along with a graphical user-interface in Shiny.
